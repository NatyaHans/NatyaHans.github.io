As the year 2021 ends, I decided to post some example of data visualization dashboards. I have been enjoying learning more about data visualization tools and decided to post sample dashboards for users to customize. I intend on keep learning more and sharing my dashboards experiences next year. 


For this first dashboard, I decided to start simple and use Google Data Studio and Google Analytics Data for tracking website traffic.
