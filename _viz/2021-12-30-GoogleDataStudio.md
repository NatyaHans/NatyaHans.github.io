As the year 2021 ends, I decided to post some example of data visualization dashboards. I have been enjoying learning more about data visualization tools and decided to post sample dashboards for users to customize. I intend on keep learning more and sharing my dashboards experiences next year. 


For this first dashboard, I decided to start simple and use Google Data Studio and Google Analytics Data for tracking website traffic.

Here is a customable dashboard you can download.

I made this for my own website for fun. Here are description of some of these reports.

Overview of User Behavior
-----
Some of the metrics I am personally interested in is average time a user(audience/visitor) spent on my site and unique page views. This personally helps me to make the content clearer and more engaging for the user.

Content drilldown
-----
For improving content to increase website traffic, this might be the most important metric, page views for each post. This helps me guage what blog posts were more popular with my audience.

Audience Geo and Demographic
-----
It is always fun to know the location of your audience to understand more about the demographic interests. For example, I know I get more visitors from Florida as my content might be relevant to people in that area. 

You can also track gender and age breakdown of your audience.

I will make a separate post for how to make this easy visualization report using data from google analytics.
