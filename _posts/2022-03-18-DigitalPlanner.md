Last year I created a digital planner using Keynote, since I wanted to use my iphone for keeping track of things. 
"Note" as a note keeping app is great but not I was looking for more organization in my schedule and reducing the clutter from my mind. 
I live in organized chaos so I wanted to give my mind a break. 

Also apparently digital planners are expensive, someone suggested me to sell this on etsy. Here is the planner I made from scratch, using the colors that made me happy.

Here is how the blank page looks like:

Here is how the dotted page looks like:

I added one page for digital coloring for calming effect:

You can download the planner in pdf format for free [here](http://NatyaHans.github.io/files/2022Planner_NatyaHans.pdf). This should be compatible with any tablet/phone.
If you want to customize colors, feel free to email and I would be happy to share the keynote file with you.
