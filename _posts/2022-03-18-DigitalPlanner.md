Last year I created a digital planner using Keynote, since I wanted to use my iphone keeping track of things. 
"Note" as a note keeping app is great but not I was looking for more organization in my schedule and reducing the clutter from my mind. 
I live in organized chaos so I wanted to give my mind a break.
Here is the planner I made from scratch, using the colors that are pleasing to me. You can download the planner for free [here]()

If you want to customize colors, feel free to email me at, I would be happy to share the keynote file with you.
