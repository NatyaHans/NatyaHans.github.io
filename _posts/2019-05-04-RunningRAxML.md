RAxML(or Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood is a program used for building large maximum likelihood inferred phylogenetic trees. It can also be used for alignment analysis or certain analysis of phylogenetic trees themselves. It was developed by [Alexis Stamatakis](https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/index.html) 
The paper on RAxML-HPC  https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/22/21/2688/251208 

For more information on RAxML and it's importance click [here for the manual](https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/resource/download/NewManual.pdf)(https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/software.html 
The wikipedia article on HiPerGator address and covers how to run mpi (parallel) version  of RAxML. I am just going to talk about how to put all that information in a single threaded.
